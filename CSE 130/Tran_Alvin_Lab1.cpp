Description: Printing out ASCII art of my professor. My syntax is ugly but for ease of formatting of the printf I ruined my syntax, 
furhtermore having reserved characters (\) for ASCII art isn't very good. Also I referenced the first image off UofL sites
I wish I could've atteneded class 1st week but things got awry and I didn't want to drive 30 minutes for only 1 class.
